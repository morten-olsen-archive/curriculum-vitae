In 2015 Trendsales decided to build an entirely new platform. It became my responsibility to create a modernized frontend architecture. The work began in 2016 with just me on the project and consisted of a proof of concept version containing everything from framework selection, structure, style guides build chain, continuous deployment, and an actual initial working version. The result where the platform which I was given technical ownership over and which I, along with two others, worked on expanding over the next year. The platform is currently powering _m.trendsales.dk_. The project is build using React and state management are done using Redux. In addition to the of the shelve frameworks, we also needed to develop quite a few bespoke frameworks, in order to meet demands. Among others, these were created to solve the following issues:

* Introducing a new navigational paradigm
* Create a more flexible routing mechanism
* Be able to serve skeleton page, for page transitions while still being able to create complete server-side pages
* Ensure project flows between multiple systems such as Github, Jira, Octopus Deploy, AppVeyor and Docker

I became responsible for the iOS platform, which was a task that required a new app to be built from the ground up using _Xamarin_[^1]. In addition to that, a new API to support the app along with support for our larger vendors was needed which had to be build using something closely similar to _Microsoft MVC_ so that other people could join the project at a later stage.

The project started in October with the initial version available to our users in late December.
This project represented my first adventure into mobile development and became an app with more than 15 million screen views and 1.5 million sessions per month.

After that, I joined two other colleagues, who were working on an Android version of the app, to form a join mobile development team.

Throughout the period I also worked on the backend for the web page from time to time.

One recurent issue when dealing with fast responding web pages is the issue of external resources, since these often comes with a short cache validity and issues such as missing compression. To improve this, I am working on a system, where installation into a platform can be offered by the external part, so for instance, _Google Tag Manager_ can be installed using a Google build installer to ensure it gets setup correct. After that the snippet lives inside the application, where it caches and serves these otherwise external resources.
