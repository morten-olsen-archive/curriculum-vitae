  In 2015 Trendsales decided to build an entirely new platform, where I was tasked with the creation of a new frontend architecture. The work began in 2016 with just me on the project and consisted of a proof of concept version containing everything from framework selection, structuring, style guides build chain, continous deployment and an actual initial working version. This is the platform I have been given technical ownership over and which I, along with 2 others, has been hard at work expanding over the past year. Currently the platform is powering _m.trendsales.dk_ and hopefully at the end of 2017 it will have taken over the entire _www.trendsales.dk_ domain. The project is build using React and state managment are done using Redux. In addition to the ofter shelve frameworks, we have also needed to develop quite a few bespoke frameworks, in order to meet demands, amongst the challenges those where created to overcome are:

  * Introducing a new navigational paradime
  * Create a more flexible routing mechanism
  * Be able to serve skeleton page, for page transitions while still being able to create complete server side pages
  * Ensure project flows between multiple systems such as Github, Jira, Octopus Delpoy, AppVeyor and Docker

  I was offered the responsibility for the iOS platform, which was a task that required a new app to be build from the ground up and had to be so using _Xamarin_[^1]. In addition to that, a new API to support the app along with support for our larger vendors was needed which had to be build using something closely simular to _Microsoft MVC_ so that other people could join the project at a later state.

  The project started in October with the initial version available to our users in late December.
  This project represent my first adventure into mobile development, and became an app with more than 15.000.000 screen views and 1.500.000 sessions pr month.

  After that, I joined two other colleagues, whom where working on an Android version of the app, to form a join mobile development team.

  One recurent issue when dealing with fast responding web pages is the issue of external resources, since these often comes with a short cache validity and issues such as missing compression. To improve this, I am working on a system, where installation into a platform can be offered by the external part, so for instance, _Google Tag Manager_ can be installed using a Google build installer to ensure it gets setup correct. After that the snippet lives inside the application, where it caches and serves these otherwise external resources.

Labyrinth Guards in itself is only a framework, which uses external services for test result gathering, currently supporting Google Analytics, but another standalone server is in the making.
