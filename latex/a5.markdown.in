This is an old project I did to play around with encryption in JavaScript. The initial boot loader is served as regular JavaScript, but after login, all communication has a level of encryption applied based upon the password, which is never sent to the server, as its encryption abilities offer this feature, without having to transfer sensitive information. It is currently available at https://wolfsquad.co/ with the username _admin_ and the password _password_
